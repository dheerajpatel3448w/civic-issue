# Fix WhatsApp Message Delivery Issue

## Problem
- Messages are sent successfully (console logs show success)
- Users do not receive the messages
- Likely due to Twilio Sandbox restrictions or incorrect configuration

## Steps to Fix
- [x] Make 'from' WhatsApp number configurable via environment variable
- [x] Make country code dynamic instead of hardcoded +91
- [x] Add better error handling and delivery status logging
- [x] Update .env file with proper Twilio WhatsApp number
- [ ] Test with actual recipient opt-in (for sandbox) or production number
